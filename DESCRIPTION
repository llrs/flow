Description: Visualize as flow diagrams the logic of functions,
    expressions or scripts in a static way or when running a call, and
    ease debugging. Advanced features include analogs to 'debug' and
    'debugonce' to target specific functions to draw, an utility to draw
    the calls used in the tests of the package in a markdown report, and
    an utility to draw all the functions of one package in a markdown
    report.
